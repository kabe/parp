The sequence to add a workflow application into PARP Database

CRT: Always newly create
NCR: Create if not exists

* TABLE WORKFLOW
workflow_name = ??? (Get at somewhere)
workflow_id = NCR(workflow.id=workflow_name)

* TABLE WORKFLOW_CONDITION
filesystem = CMDLINE ??? Filesystem that has data
location = CMDLINE ??? Environment name or cluster name
worker_num = CMDLINE ??? Number of worker: from the modified GXP Make
workflow_condition_id = NCR(workflow_condition.id=(filesystem, location, worker_num))

* TABLE WORKFLOW_TRIAL
workflow_trial_id = CRT(workflow_trial_id=(workflow_id, workflow_condition_id))

* TABLE APPLICATION
application_name = From GXP DB
application_id = Max value in workflow_id + 1 (NCR)

* TABLE JOB
Retrieve rest data from GXP DB
job_id = CRT(all)

* TABLE METRIC

metric_id = CRT
